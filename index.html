                <p>
                    My why is because I want to learn about how computers can be used to benefit the communities around me.
                    Since I was in high school I was always fascinated by programming, but I had wanted to become an aerospace engineer.
                    However, when I came to Morehouse College, I decided to enter as a computer science major.
                    Since then, I have had amazing contacts that helped me to research in fascinating topics. 
                    Specifically, in virtual reality, as well as research in how we perceive and react to our environments.
                    I want to pay that forward to the next generation.
